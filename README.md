# PianoSim

This is a pianotile-like game that utilizes a physical Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board as a controller. There are additional keyboard controls:
- Keys S through K represent the regular keys
- Keys E, R, Y, U, and I represent the sharp/flat keys
- Keys 1 and 2 change the current keyboard octave

To run this project, clone or download the repository and open the folder through Unity Hub.
